# TIC-TAC-TOE
Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game where the goal is to be the first to get three of your marks (either 'X' or 'O') in a row on a 3x3 grid. Here's a quick overview of how the game works.
I use  html ,css and javascript for the implementation , having darkmode and lightmode property just on taping on the TIC-TAC-TOE.

Rules
Grid: The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
Players: Two players take turns, one using 'X' and the other 'O'.
Objective: The first player to get three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
Draw: If all nine squares are filled and no player has three in a row, the game is a draw.
